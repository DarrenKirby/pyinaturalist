**Which API endpoint would you like to add?**
(Optionally with documentation link) e.g.: [`GET /observations`](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/#!/Observations/get_observations)

**Is there any special behavior that you would like this to have?**
e.g., _This endpoint should accept coordinates as python `float`s and translate them to valid GeoJSON._
